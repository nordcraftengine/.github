# Welcome to Nordcraft

Nordcraft is an open-source Web Development Engine that combines visual design tools, a front-end framework built on web standards, and full programming capabilities in a single platform.

**Nordcraft is for web designers who want to deliver great experiences to their users.**

If youâ€™re using Nordcraft in a product team, you get to skip that traditional handover process from design to development. Using Nordcraft as a web designer, you can build web applications as you design the UI, while the engineers in your team can focus on building out the business logic and the back end.
